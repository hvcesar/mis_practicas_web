    They say, oh my god, I see the way you shine
    Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine
    You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
    And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
    Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
    And, oh my, I, I, I like your style
    You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
    And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    So they say
    Dance for me
    Dance for me
    Dance for me oh oh oh
    I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
    They say
    Move for me
    Move for me
    Move for me ay ay ay
    And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again

    I said, oh my god, I see you walking by
    Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
    Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life
    But you just beg to see me dance just one more time
    Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
    And, oh my, I, I, I,
    I like your style
    You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
    And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
